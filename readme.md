This is an interactive tool which allows you to write [jsel](https://github.com/dragonworx/jsel) XPATH expressions and test the results againt any data you paste in.

You can also control the mappings and aliases and it's very useful for testing expressions against arbitrary data.

This tool used to be hosted on www.jselement.org but this site was shutdown in mid 2015 by the author due to other commitments.

The source code is now free and available. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser to use the tool.

Good luck with your **jsel** projects!
